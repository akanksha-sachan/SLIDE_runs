SLIDE :Significant Latent Factor Interaction Discovery and Exploration across biological domains
============================================
 
 
 Here, we present SLIDE, a novel data-distribution-free approach to analyze high-dimensional multiomic datasets and uncover latent factors that drive the outcome of interest.
 - SLIDE makes no assumptions regarding the distribution of the underlying data as it significantly builds on a unique latent-factor regression framework.
 - It takes into account an extremely large search space of relationships to converge on a very small subset of biologically relevant and actionable latent factors.
 - Critically, SLIDE incorporates both linear and nonlinear relationships, including complex hierarchical structures.
 - The discovery of SLIDE is also coupled to rigorous false discovery rate (FDR) control via our unique analytical framework that creatively adapts ultramodern methods for FDR control

## Installation Procedure
# SLIDE
First install `SLIDE` in R by running the following code from a  R command terminal:



```library(devtools)```   
```devtools::install_github("jishnu-lab/SLIDE")```
Requires R â‰¥ 4.2


## Running the software

For running the software please refer to `vignette` folder. 




## Hardware Requirements
For minimal performance of the ```SLIDE```,  a computer with about 8 GB of RAM is required. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core
